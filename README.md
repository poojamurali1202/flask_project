# flask_project
This repository contains flask application connected with mongodb.

This is a Flask application that connects to MongoDB (localhost) and uses JWT-based authentication. It includes user registration, login, and template management features. The application is deployed using Koyeb with a GitHub repository.



1. Develop a **Flask application** and install all required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  

2. Configure **MongoDB** to connect with **localhost** after completing the installation.  

3. Implement **JSON Web Token (JWT)-based authentication** for secure user access.  

4. Create API endpoints for user and template management, including:  
   - **User Authentication:** Register and login users.  
   - **Template Operations:** Create, retrieve (single/all), update, and delete templates as per requirements.  

5. Use **Postman** to test all **Flask API endpoints** and verify functionality.  

6. Deploy the Flask application using **Koyeb**, an open-source cloud platform.  

7. In **Koyeb**, create an application linked to the **GitHub repository** containing the Flask project. Ensure that the repository includes:  
   - A **`requirements.txt`** file specifying dependencies.  
   - A **`Procfile`** with the necessary commands to run the Flask application.  

8. In Koyebâ€™s **Build Settings**, set the **base directory** to `myflask_project` and proceed with deployment.
